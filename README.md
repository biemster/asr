Android offline speech recognition natively on PC. This repository contains tools used to reverse engineer the RNN based speech recognition from Google products.
The [project page](https://hackaday.io/project/164399-android-offline-speech-recognition-natively-on-pc) outlines the current progress.
A client to run this on PC is kept in a different repository: [biemster/gasr](https://github.com/biemster/gasr).
